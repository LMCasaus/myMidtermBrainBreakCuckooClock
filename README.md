# myMidtermBrainBreakCuckooClock
This is my brain break, break your brain, beaucoup, cuckoo clock
## Why did I make this clock?
To encourage hourly breaks with sensory brain breaks, designed to recalibrate the brain after long periods of sitting.
This will be useful in classrooms and desk work focused areas where sitting is the norm.
